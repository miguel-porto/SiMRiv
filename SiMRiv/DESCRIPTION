Description: This package provides functions to generate spatially-explicit simulations of multi-state movements
  in heterogeneous landscapes, based on "resistance" rasters. Although originally conceived and designed to fill
  the gap of softwares simulating trajectories of species constrained to linear, dendritic habitats
  (e.g., river networks), the simulation algorithm is built to be highly flexible. Thus, the user will be able to
  use the package to simulate movements either in homogeneous landscapes, heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. semi-aquatic
  animal in a riverscape), or even in highly contrasted landscapes (e.g. fish in a river network). The algorithm
  and its input parameters are the same for all cases, so that results are comparable.
  Simulated trajectories can then be used as null models to test e.g. for species site fidelity (Powell 2000) and
  other movement ecology hypotheses, or to build predictive, mechanistic movement models (Moorcroft and Lewis 2006),
  among other things. The package should thus be relevant to explore a broad spectrum of ecological phenomena,
  such as those at the interface of animal behaviour, landscape, spatial and movement ecology, disease and invasive
  species's spread, and population dynamics.
  This is the first released experimental version; do test before using in production.
